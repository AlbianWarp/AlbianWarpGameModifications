# AlbianWarp - Game Modifications

This repositorry contains the Creatures 3/Docking Station Game modifications needed for AlbianWarp to work.

## Installation

The Bootstrap directory must be copied into the Docking Station installation directory, if you downloaded Creatures Exodus from gog.com, the standard installation directory should be `C:\GOG Games\Creatures Exodus\Docking Station` The Bootsrap directory will then integrate into the original Bootstrap directory without overwriting any of the original files.

## Usage

The Game Modification by itself are not very usefull, as they are only used by the [AlbianWarpClient](https://github.com/AlbianWarp/AlbianWarpClient).
