Hello I do not know how to write a readme.

This non-overwriting set of files should get the Albian Warp Client talking to your game nicely-- you shouldn't need to replace anything (well except maybe old AW files). 

It also kinda sorta works with mail now, but you'll need to receive a test message and establish a contact before you can use the UI for things.

Thinnnngsssss
