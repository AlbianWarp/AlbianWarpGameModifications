# AlbianWarp - Game Modifications

This repository contains the Creatures 3/Docking Station Game modifications needed for AlbianWarp to work.

## Installation

The Bootstrap directory must be copied into the Docking Station installation directory, if you downloaded Creatures Exodus from gog.com, the standard installation directory should be `C:\GOG Games\Creatures Exodus\Docking Station` The Bootstrap directory will then integrate into the original Bootstrap directory. 

The bootstrap should only overwrite one file at most-- the file called 'reinject_updated_agents.cos' in the 'dsbuild 195' directory. A backup of this file is provided in the same directory should you wish to restore it later. Note that restoring the file will disable the functionality of Albian Warp.

## Usage

The Game Modification by itself are not very useful, as they are only used by the [AlbianWarpClient](https://github.com/AlbianWarp/AlbianWarpClient).
