# AlbianWarp - Game Modifications

This repository contains the Creatures 3/Docking Station Game modifications needed for AlbianWarp to work.

## Installation

The Bootstrap directory must be copied into the Docking Station installation directory, if you downloaded Creatures Exodus from gog.com, the standard installation directory should be `C:\GOG Games\Creatures Exodus\Docking Station` The Bootstrap directory will then integrate into the original Bootstrap directory without overwriting any of the original files.

Note that if you have a folder called 'dsbuild 195' in your bootstrap folder containing a file called 'reinject_updated_agents.cos' you will need to move, delete, or rename the extention of that file to stop it from re-overwriting the Albian Warp scripts. 

## Usage

The Game Modification by itself are not very useful, as they are only used by the [AlbianWarpClient](https://github.com/AlbianWarp/AlbianWarpClient).
